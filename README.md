## <a id="Project-Description">Project Description</a>


We provide a client-facing product that allows end-users to understand how their loan application, or general credit profile would be viewed by prospective institutional lenders.
In future iterations of our product, users will be able to account for the situational nature of lending practices present in real companies. This context-driven approach will factor in the behavior of fixed income securities markets along with client-provided information in order to provide a better user experience.
Factoring in personal information alongside relevant macroeconomic data will allow a client to walk away with a clear understanding of their financial position in the current market climate.<br>
